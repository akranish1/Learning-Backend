What is MVC (Model–View–Controller) in Node.js?
It’s a design pattern used to organize code into separate layers, so your project doesn’t become messy.

Model → Handles data
View → Handles presentation(FrontEnd)
Controller → Handles requests & responses.

With MVC:
Separation of concerns
Reusability
Maintainability
Collaboration

MVC is widely used and accepted in industry.
