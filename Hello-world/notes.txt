//Things which are not present in nodejs are : alert,windows and other DOM

commands: 
node (filename); //to run js file without the browser
npm init: //to create package.json

npm init makes your Node.js project shareable, maintainable, and 
reproducible by creating a package.json file to track dependencies and project metadata.

like i have installed express: without package.json my friend will not be able to
know what to install, but after init than npm i express, this dependencies will be
added automatically, and my friend will have to just install npm
