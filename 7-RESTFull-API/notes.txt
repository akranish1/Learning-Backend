RESTfull/REST API: API + some rules
there are various types of API, one of them is REST API


API RESPONSE are of various types: image, text, HTML, JSON;
when you request data from Server through Browser , It can give RESPONSE in HTML(SSR)
SSR (SERVER SIDE RENDERING) these are faster than JSON data which is raw and gets render at client side so CSR
CSR is done by front end tech like React;

============================================

Talking about rules,they are:
Use HTTP methods correctly (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). like not only using GET & POST for everything
Use URLs (endpoints) to represent resources.
Use stateless requests (server doesnâ€™t remember who you are between calls).
Data is usually sent/received in JSON.
